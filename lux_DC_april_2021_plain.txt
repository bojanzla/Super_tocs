Coverage Type and Terms
A "Seller’s Coverage" Plan is enrolled on the home by or on behalf of a prospective home seller on or after the date when the property is listed for sale with a real estate broker. By enrolling in a Seller’s Coverage Plan, seller agrees to provide the homebuyer with a Super home warranty paid out of the proceeds of the closing. Seller’s Coverage Plan term begins upon our issuance of the Plan and continues for 180 days, until close of escrow, or upon termination of listing (whichever occurs first). Optional coverages are not covered during the Seller’s Coverage term. We may extend the Seller’s Coverage at our sole discretion. Should Super extend the Seller’s coverage term, an extra fee may be charged. Seller’s Coverage ends and a new Buyer’s Coverage Plan begins for the Covered Location (as that term is defined on the Declarations Page) on the date of closing (title transfer), provided we receive the required payment within twenty (20) business days of closing.In the event that a Seller’s Coverage plan expires or is cancelled after a service request has been made on the Covered Location, and if the Super home warranty fee has not been paid, the contract holder will be responsible for the purchase of the selected Super home warranty or reimbursement to us for the total of (a) any service costs incurred, (b) unpaid service fees, and (c) any inspection costs incurred, whichever is less. Cancellation of this contract must be in writing. 
A "Buyer’s Coverage" Plan is purchased in conjunction with a real estate transaction by or on behalf of a home buyer up to fifteen (15) days after the closing date. A Buyer’s Coverage Plan begins on the closing date and continues until the Plan Expiration Date as indicated on the declarations page of this Agreement. Plan fee must be received within twenty (20) business days of closing date. 
A “New Construction” Plan is purchased in conjunction with a real estate transaction of a  newly constructed home by or on behalf of a home buyer up to thirty (30) business days of closing date. A New Construction Coverage Plan begins one (1) year from the original closing date and continues for four (4) years from that date. Plan fee must be received within twenty (20) business days of the closing date. 
An "Existing Home Coverage" Plan is available to homeowners not immediately purchasing or selling their home (i.e., when the home is not listed for sale and/or it is more than fifteen (15) business days after closing), is effective fifteen (15) days after we receive the required payment (unless we otherwise agree in writing) and continues until the Plan Expiration Date as indicated on the declarations page of this Agreement. Pre-existing breakdowns and defects, both known and unknown, are not covered under the Existing Homeowner Coverage plan. The Plan holder must have all known pre-existing breakdowns correctly repaired by a Super Service Pro or a service contractor of his/her choice and deliver to us any paid invoices evidencing the repairs, before the defective item can be covered by this Plan.

Coverage This Plan covers each system and item registered on the declarations page of this Agreement (“Covered Items”).
In accordance with the terms and conditions of this Plan, we will repair or replace the Covered Items so long as they:
Are in good, safe, and proper working order and correctly installed at the Covered Location on the Plan Effective Date (as that term is defined on the Declarations Page) of this Plan;
Become inoperative from normal wear and tear after the Plan Effective Date;
Are classified by the manufacturer as residential (we do not cover systems classified as commercial);

Claims Process
Plan holder, Plan holder’s agent, or tenant must notify Super of any malfunction of a covered system or appliance via our website, our mobile application, by email, by texting 844-669-4232, or by calling (844) 997-8737 as soon as the problem is discovered, and prior to the expiration date, for covered work to be performed under this Plan.
Super has the sole right to select and arrange an authorized Super Service Pro to perform work covered by this Plan. Only work authorized and arranged by Super is covered by this Plan. The term “Service Pro” refers to licensed contractors. We will not reimburse you for service performed by your own contractor without our prior authorization.
Service Fee. For each separate trade item, you are responsible to pay Super via credit card the service fee listed on the declarations page. The service fee will be due and payable to Super at the time of scheduled service request. If the Super Service Pro cannot access the property at the time of the scheduled service request, you may be required to pay an additional service fee to reschedule an appointment. Failure to pay service fees could result in suspension or cancellation of the Plan.
Service Response Times.
Normal Service. Under normal circumstances, we will contact you within 4 business hours (48 hours on weekends/holidays) to schedule a mutually convenient appointment during normal business hours to perform non-emergency service.
Emergency Service. An emergency is defined as a plumbing failure that causes interior flooding, a complete loss of heating or cooling in extreme temperature conditions, a substantial loss of electrical service, or any other condition that renders the interior of the home uninhabitable. Super will make all reasonable efforts to expedite emergency service. 24-hour emergency service is only available for interior flooding. Super will determine what services constitute an emergency and will make all reasonable efforts to prioritize and expedite emergency service.
Expediting Normal Service. Super will accept your request to expedite non-emergency service only if an authorized Super Service Pro is available. If the Super Service Pro agrees to expedite the scheduling of non-emergency service, you will be responsible for any additional fees, including overtime pay.   
Second Opinions. Super reserves the right to obtain a second opinion at its own expense. In the event that Super informs you the malfunction is not covered; you have the right to request a second opinion of the cause of the malfunction. You must ask Super for a second opinion from another Super Service Pro within seven (7) days from the time Super informed you the malfunction was not covered. In the event that the outcome of the second opinion is that the malfunction should be covered, you will not owe an additional service fee. If you request a second opinion and the outcome of the second opinion is also that the malfunction is not covered, you will be responsible for the payment of an additional service fee.
Service Guarantee. We will warrant a repair service for thirty (30) days from the date of repair completion. Should failure of that repair occur within thirty (30) days, we will not charge you another service fee.
Cash in Lieu. Super reserves the right to offer cash in lieu of repair or replacement in the amount of Super’s actual cost (which may be less than retail) to repair or replace any covered item. If Super makes the determination to provide the Plan Holder cash in lieu of repair or replacement, we will make payment within 30 days from the time that determination is made. If we provide cash in lieu of repair or replacement of a covered item, that item will not be covered until you have provided us with paid invoices or receipts evidencing that it has been correctly repaired or replaced by a Service Pro.
Replacement. If Super determines, at its sole discretion, that your Covered Item cannot be repaired, Super will provide a replacement up to the limits indicated on the declaration page of this Plan. When making replacements, Super is responsible for installing replacement equipment and parts of similar features, capacity, and efficiency, but not for matching dimensions or brand except as provided by the Brand-for-Brand Upgrade. Super reserves the right to offer cash in lieu of replacement according to the terms of this Plan as described in paragraph 4.g of this Agreement. Super is not responsible for matching any feature of an existing item that does not contribute to the primary function of that item.
Rights of Recovery. We may require you to assign us your rights of recovery against others. We will not pay for a claim if you impair these rights to recover. Your right to recover may not be waived.

However, coverage is not all inclusive. There may be situations in which you will be responsible to pay additional costs for parts or services not covered by this Plan. In those cases, we will work with you to determine the best course of action to reasonably minimize your out-of-pocket costs.
General Exclusions. This Plan does not cover:
Known defects that existed on or before the Plan Effective Date. The Plan holder must have all known pre-existing breakdowns and defects correctly repaired by a Super Service Pro or service professional and deliver to us any paid invoices evidencing the repairs before the defective item can be covered by this Plan.

Pest or pet damage. 
Failure of parts or components caused by the lack of manufacturer recommended maintenance is not covered unless it’s a Buyer’s Coverage Plan and the condition pre-dated the effective date, was not known by the Plan holder, and would not have been detectable by a state certified home inspection or visual inspection and simple operating test.

Miscellaneous
Mandatory Arbitration. Super and the Plan holder will attempt in good faith to resolve any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to this Plan through direct discussions. If these discussions are unsuccessful, all disputes or claims between the parties arising out of the Plan or the parties’ relationship shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration administered through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. Copies of the AAA Rules and forms can be obtained at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. The parties expressly agree that this Agreement and this arbitration provision involve and concern interstate commerce and are governed by the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) to the exclusion of any different or inconsistent state or local law, ordinance or judicial rule. By entering into this Agreement, the parties acknowledge that they are giving up the right to a jury trial, and the right to participate in any class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or consolidated action, including any class arbitration or consolidated arbitration proceeding. 
Class Action Waiver. Any Claim must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. The arbitrator shall not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, HOWEVER, THEY UNDERSTAND AND CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY, THROUGH ARBITRATION.

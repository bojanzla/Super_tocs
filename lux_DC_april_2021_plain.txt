General Provisions: Coverage Type and Terms A "Seller’s Coverage" Plan is enrolled on the home by or on behalf of a prospective home seller on or after the date when the property is listed for sale with a real estate broker
By enrolling in a Seller’s Coverage Plan, seller agrees to provide the homebuyer with a Super home warranty paid out of the proceeds of the closing
Seller’s Coverage Plan term begins upon our issuance of the Plan and continues for 180 days, until close of escrow, or upon termination of listing (whichever occurs first)
Optional coverages are not covered during the Seller’s Coverage term
We may extend the Seller’s Coverage at our sole discretion
Should Super extend the Seller’s coverage term, an extra fee may be charged
Seller’s Coverage ends and a new Buyer’s Coverage Plan begins for the Covered Location (as that term is defined on the Declarations Page) on the date of closing (title transfer), provided we receive the required payment within twenty (20) business days of closing
In the event that a Seller’s Coverage plan expires or is cancelled after a service request has been made on the Covered Location, and if the Super home warranty fee has not been paid, the contract holder will be responsible for the purchase of the selected Super home warranty or reimbursement to us for the total of (a) any service costs incurred, (b) unpaid service fees, and (c) any inspection costs incurred, whichever is less
Cancellation of this contract must be in writing

A Buyer’s Coverage Plan begins on the closing date and continues until the Plan Expiration Date as indicated on the declarations page of this Agreement
Plan fee must be received within twenty (20) business days of closing date

OPtional Coverages  The following coverages are optional and may be added to this plan at the time of purchase for an additional fee.
HVAC EQUIPMENT INCOMPATIBILITY COVERAGE  Note:The EPA and the Federal Government has mandated the complete phase out of the most commonly used refrigerant in air conditioning systems, R-22 (Freon), by January 1, 2020
While manufacturers have produced legal alternative refrigerants that may be used in R-22 air conditioning equipment, it’s anticipated that air conditioning manufacturers will stop producing air conditioning parts and equipment that utilize R-22 refrigerant on or about January 1, 2020 when R-22 will be completely phased out
When R-22 and R-22 air conditioning parts and equipment are no longer available, your entire air conditioning system must be upgraded and replaced with a new air conditioning system that utilizes a non-ozone depleting refrigerant called R-410a (Puron)
Because home warranties do not cover upgrades, this phase-out will have a significant financial impact for homeowners
This coverage will pay all additional costs to upgrade your R-22 air conditioning system to a R-410 air conditioning system when Super determines that your R-22 condenser or air handler must be replaced
The retail cost of upgrading an air handler or condenser is over $2,500
Description of Covered Items: When Super replaces an R-22 condenser or air handler, if any replacement parts become incompatible with the existing equipment due to changes in the federally mandated refrigerant standards and efficiency standards (13 SEER to 14 SEER), Super will upgrade the existing covered air conditioning equipment to maintain compatibility and to meet the new federal standards
Conditions and Items Not Covered: Plenum; transition; structural modifications
